# the-shoppies-awards

This project is my submission for the UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge. It is built upon my [boilerplate-cra-nodejs](https://github.com/shinellm/boilerplate-cra-nodejs) project, which has a [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) frontend and a custom Node backend (server for API, proxy, & routing).

In this project you are presented with a webpage that can search OMDB for movies. It allows users to save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination in The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs. 

#### Project features:
* The webpage searches OMDB and displays movies only
* Users can add a movie from the search results to their nomination list
* Users can view the list of films already nominated
* Users can Remove a nominee from their nomination list
* Users can nominate up to 5 of their favorite films
